Currently, only Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 32-bit is supported.  We recommend you do a clean install before running the script here.

As always, read the script before blindly executing code from the internet but here is the one-liner to bootstrap your ADHD installation.

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adhdproject/buildkit/master/adhd-0.7.0-install.sh | sudo bash -s
```
